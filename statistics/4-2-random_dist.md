[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

'''

Exercise 4.2 The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be
uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the
same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF.
Is the distribution uniform?

# Code
```
import random
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

N=1000
rng=[]
for ii in range(N):
    rng.append(random.random())
    
plt.figure()
heights,bins = np.histogram(rng,bins=50)
heights = heights/sum(heights)
plt.bar(bins[:-1],heights,width=(max(bins) - min(bins))/len(bins), color="blue")
plt.title('PMF')

# Plots CDF
plt.figure()
counts, bin_edges = np.histogram(rng, bins=50, normed=True)
## Now find the cdf
cdf = np.cumsum(counts)
## And finally plot the cdf
plt.plot(bin_edges[1:], cdf)
plt.title('CDF')
```

# Answer
>> Is the distribution is uniform
